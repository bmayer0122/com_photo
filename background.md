Stacking is the base operation for everything. 

[Epsilon Photography]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsilon_photography)
This is the idea that you take lots of pictures and change parameters so that you have flexability later to combine. 
Think about changing the apature while taking a bunch of pictures.

Applications are: "focal stack photography,[clarification needed] High dynamic range (HDR) photography, lucky imaging, multi-image panorama stitching and confocal stereo."
These are exciting items to me.
The HDR is very useful due to the limitations of digital sensors.
Lucky imaging is a technique that I know from Astrophotography where they record video of the object and simply take the frames that have the least amount of atmospheric distortion and use those.

As these techniques can require a great many images "Compressive Epsilon Photography" takes fewer images and the intermediate images are generated.

"A modern smartphone camera starts taking photos as soon as you open it. 
Which is logical, since it should show the image on screen somehow. 
But in addition to that, it saves high-resolution images to its cyclic buffer and stores them for a couple more seconds."

And at the end lifts some content from the Google Pixel blog posts.

Marc Levoy is amazing in that he changes areas every decade because he solved the big problems. He lead the photography team at Google Pixel and has a good deal of content on the web.
