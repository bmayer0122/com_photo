# Computational Photography
Goal: Learn more about computational photography

Goal: Use computational photography on at least a simple example

TODO: This should probably be organized into a table of contents with sub-pages so it doesn't get too big or busy.

## Specific Interests
Ben:
Upon starting my primary interest is in low light work and maybe HDR with wider brackets. 
I like panoramas, but I am not sure if there is a need due to existing software and wide angle hardware being in our pockets, not telephoto.
Maybe the better set of techniques would be astrophotography based, but the last time I tried that I couldn't get any software to work across Windows, Mac or Linux.

# Notes
What would be a good aberivation for "Computational Photography"? CP brings forth unpleasent words.
