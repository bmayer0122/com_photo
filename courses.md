### REQUIRED TEXTS 
Computational photography is a new and exciting field. No standard texts on this topic are available yet. Optional texts include:

• Forsyth and Ponce. Computer Vision: A Modern Approach. Pearson. 2002.

• Richard Szeliski. Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications. Springer. 2010.

• Berthold K. P. Horn. Robot Vision. The MIT Press. 1986.

• R. Hartley and A. Zisserman. Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision, Cambridge Press, Cambridge, UK, 2000.

### DETAILED COURSE TOPICS

• Image formation: pinhole camera, lens camera model, sensor noise

• Lenses: focusing, zoom, field of view, aberrations

• Color: color filter arrays, demosaicking

• Radiometetry and photometry

• Metering: autofocusing, auto-exposure

• Image processing: Fourier Transform, blur, convolution

• Camera projective modeling and calibration

• Depth estimation: stereo matching, photometric stereo, depth from defocus

• Material acquisition: BRDF acquisition, multispectral/hyperspectral capture

• High dynamic range imaging

• Light field capture and rendering

• Computational illumination: image relighting, light transport

• Compressive imaging: super-resolution, compressive video/light field capture

• Novel displays: 3D displays, HDR displays

## CMU
[CMU](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/)
There are some slides, assignments ** This is running NOW! **
There are recorded lectures, but they are behind a CMU login screen

The pre-reqs include image and video processing, which requires Signals and Systems which requires Fundamentals of Signal Processing. 
So let's not get hung up in that math stuff, and see what we can do before we figure out what math to learn.
I am wonder if addition and division are going to be key components with maybe some rotation.

### Textbooks
Readings will be assigned primarily from relevant papers. Readings will be posted at the last slide of each lecture.
Additionally readings may be assigned from the following textbooks, which can also be useful references in general. 
All of them are available online from the CMU library:

Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications, by Richard Szeliski.

Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision, by Richard Hartley and Andrew Zisserman.

Computer Vision: A Modern Approach, by David Forsyth and Jean Ponce.

Foundations of 3D Computer Graphics, by Steven Gortler.

Digital Image Processing, by Rafael Gonzalez and Richard Woods.

Photography, by Barbara London and John Upton
